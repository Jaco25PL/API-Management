# Technical Test where we are gonna to manage two APIs

**APIs**

- Random Facts: (link)[https://catfact.ninja/fact]
- Random Image: (link)[https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello]

Get a random cat fact and show a cat image with the first word of the fact

So what I think we've to do is, with one click render a random image and a random text, BUT, the cat image should contain the first word of the text, as we can see, in the cat's URL, the last paramter indicates the word the image should show, in that case each image will have the word 'hello'
